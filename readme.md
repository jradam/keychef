###### A tiny keyboard layer management tool

### Why do I exist?

If you do any programming, you might agree that brackets and symbols are used frequently, but are relatively difficult to reach on the keyboard. This small tool adds a new keyboard layer that puts these keys closer to the home row.

### Usage

Activate the new layer by holding `on_activate` (default `;`).

Your `on_activate` key will not be sent, so ensure you bind this to a new key on the new layer.

KeyChef can also send an on_activate key (default `F13`).
